# ContextMenu_OpenFolderInVSCode
Registry Entry to add right-click context menu for folders: Open in VSCode.

Maybe this will save you some clicking/typing. For Windows (installed/tested on Win 11).

## OVERVIEW
Implements the advice posted at StackOverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20449316/how-add-context-menu-item-to-windows-explorer-for-folders

This reg file is set to operate on the user, not machine.

In short, edit the reg file to provide your Windows 11 username. Check the paths match your VSCode installation, of course!
