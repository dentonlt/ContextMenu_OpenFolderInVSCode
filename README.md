# ContextMenu_OpenFolderInVSCode
Registry Entry to add right-click context menu for folders: Open in VSCode.

Maybe this will save you some clicking/typing. For Windows (installed/tested on Win 11).

## OVERVIEW
Implements the advice posted at StackOverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20449316/how-add-context-menu-item-to-windows-explorer-for-folders

In short, edit the reg file to provide your Windows 11 username. This is set by user, not machine.

Check the paths match your VSCode installation, of course.
